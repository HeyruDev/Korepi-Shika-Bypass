Shika–Korepi Bypass – Advanced High-Kernel Hoyoprotect Bypass

The Shika–Korepi Bypass is an advanced, high-kernel-level bypass solution specifically engineered to defeat Hoyoprotect security with unmatched stability and safety.
Operating at the highest kernel layer, it provides direct access to critical system functions while remaining completely undetected by standard security mechanisms.

Key Features:

High-Kernel Execution – Runs at the highest kernel privilege level, bypassing detection with maximum efficiency.

Full Hoyoprotect Evasion – Capable of bypassing all Hoyoprotect modules, including the latest patches and updates.

Multi-Region Safe – Fully tested and proven safe on all servers: ASIA, AMERICA, EUROPE, and TWHK.

High Stability – Months of continuous testing without crashes, errors, or compatibility issues.

Ongoing Support & Updates – Regular maintenance and updates to stay ahead of Hoyoprotect security improvements.

Security & Reliability:

Minimal system footprint to avoid any traceable detection.

No leftover files or active services after execution.

Built-in anti-detection mechanisms running in real time.

Testing Results:

Testing duration: ~3 months with zero detections reported.

Test environments: ASIA, AMERICA, EUROPE, TWHK servers.

Status: 100% safe and stable throughout all test sessions.
